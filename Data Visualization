I have successfully completed data visualization projects, including forecasting annual sales for an e-commerce store. These projects were part of virtual internships offered by KPMG and Tata, where I gained hands-on experience in data analysis and dashboard development. 

These experiences have equipped me with valuable skills in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights, fostering a strong foundation in data-driven decision-making.
