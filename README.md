**ðŸ“Š Data Visualization and Dashboards Building**

A Data Analytics & Visualization Project

This repository showcases my successful completion of data visualization projects, including the forecasting of annual sales for an e-commerce store. The projects were part of virtual internships offered by KPMG and Tata, where I gained hands-on experience in data analysis and dashboard development.

**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**

In these projects, I focused on transforming raw business data into clear, interactive, and insightful visualizations. By utilizing data analysis and visualization tools, I helped companies like KPMG and Tata make data-driven decisions. The projects mainly involved building dashboards to forecast sales, monitor business performance, and analyze trends for actionable insights.

**Business Intelligence Tools:**

Power BI

**Data Analysis:**

Time Series Analysis
Forecasting Methods

**ðŸ“‚ Key Features of the Project**
